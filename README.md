This code is an example of how an Ethereum-compatible blockchain can help connect financial institutions, through smart contracts that automate some company finances to make everyone's lives easier, increase transparency, and to make accounting and auditing practically automatic!

There are 3 contracts included, which handle different functions. These contracts:


[Pay your Associate-level employees quickly and easily.](solidity/AssociateProfitSplitter.sol)


[Distribute profits to different tiers of employees.](solidity/TieredProfitSplitter.sol)


[Distribute company shares for employees in a "deferred equity incentive plan" automatically.](solidity/DeferredEquityPlan.sol)
